Modelling Sweden in terms of electric energy balance using wind data from 
2020 - 2021. From this extrapolations in terms of adding more wind or Heat
energy can be explored. The model assumes the following

Balance:
    Consumption + Export = Production + Import
If some constraints are mot fulfilled, balance may not be achieved and we'll
get either a shortage or excess of power.

Hourly data:
The simulation is based on hourly data during 2020-2021. A dataframe is
constructed with columns for Consumtion+Export, Constant (nuclear + heat,
based), Water inflow/outflow, Import/Export, Hydrogen need plus some other
parameters. All per hour. Power/Energy in GW (for one hour => GWh).

Power dispatch:
The balance equations are made such that
1. Consumtion, Constant power and Wind power are given (that is,
"dispatched" first)
2. Water (hydro) power is used to balance production against consumption
3. Hydrogen production is adjusted within limits when water balancing
   is not enough
3. If still not balanced, import or export is used
4. If import or export limits are hit we get a shortage or an excess of power.

Wind power:
Hourly wind power production data is taken from ENTSO-E transparency platform.
To emulate more wind power in the future, the hourly values are simply scaled
with a scale factor. That is a scale factor of 2 would simply double the wind
power production, with the same statistical dispersion.

Consumtion (as well as Const power production) follows a sinusoidal curve that
emulates the usage over the year (that is higher consumption in winter, lower
in summer). Const power production have a similar pattern ( that is less power
from heat, NPP maintenance during summer).

Hydrogen production is handled in terms of energy needed to produce it. "eStore"
is an ideal store of produced H2. Energy flows into it at production rates and
energy is drained at rate corresponding to the mean production. 

A balance energy store functionality is included to simulate the size of a
store needed to cover the deficit that may appear when having a large share
of wind power.

See https://adelsfors.se/2022/11/18/a-simple-balance-model-for-swedens-electricity-power-system/
for a description of the model.
